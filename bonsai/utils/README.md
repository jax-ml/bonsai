# Utilities

This folder contains functions which are broadly applicable to large classes of models. Code changes will only be accepted for this folder if they satisfy the following criteria:
- **Modularity**: Classes and functions in each file should be self contained. They should not depend on code in the rest of the repo. 
- **Minimal**: The code in these folders should introduce very little abstraction to maintain simplicity. 
- **Documentation**: The code in this section should be well documented and should include concise examples.

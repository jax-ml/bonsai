Bonsai is a minimal, lightweight JAX implementation of popular models.

We're committed to making popular models accessible in JAX through simple, hackable, and concise code. Our aim is to lower the barrier to entry for JAX and promote academic innovation.

## üèÅ Getting Started

To get started with JAX Bonsai, follow these steps to set up your development environment and run the models.

Alternatively, run the CLI ([docs](./CLI_USAGE.md)).

### Installation

```bash
python3 -m pip install 'git+https://github.com/jax-ml/bonsai'
```

### Development

Clone the JAX Bonsai repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jax-ml/bonsai.git
cd bonsai
```

Install the latest repository.
```bash
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

### Running models

Jump right into our [Qwen3](bonsai/models/qwen3) model, implemented in [300 lines of code](bonsai/models/qwen3/modeling.py) in JAX.

```sh
python3 -m bonsai.models.qwen3.tests.run_model
```

Or alternatively:
```sh
python3 -m bonsai run -n qwen3
```

#  Bonsai

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Bonsai is a minimal, lightweight JAX implementation of popular models.

We're committed to making popular models accessible in JAX through simple, hackable, and concise code. Our aim is to lower the barrier to entry for JAX and promote academic innovation.

## Models

The following models are part of Bonsai. We have included the current model status here to easily convey which models are ready for full use. We categorize them as follows:
1. ✅ Ready with broad support
2. ⚙️ Adding additional features
4. 🟡 In progress
5. ⏳ Coming soon (has open PR)

These are listed based on status and then alphabetically.

Got models you'd like to see in JAX? [Add a request](https://github.com/jax-ml/bonsai/issues) or [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md). Please refer to the open issues and PRs before creating a new one to see if a feature is already being addressed.

## 🏁 Getting Started

To get started with JAX Bonsai, follow these steps to set up your development environment and run the models.

### Installation

Clone the JAX Bonsai repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jax-ml/bonsai.git
cd bonsai
```

Install the latest repository.
```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Running models

Jump right into our [Qwen3](bonsai/models/qwen3) model, implemented in [400 lines of code](bonsai/models/qwen3/modeling.py) in JAX.

```python
python bonsai/models/qwen3/tests/run_model.py
```
